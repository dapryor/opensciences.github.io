## About
I am a student at N.C. State University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in 
math. I started working as a curator and programmer on OpenScience in January 2015, and since 
then, I've added a bunch of datasets to the repo and overhauled the site with Bootstrap.

My interests include entrepreneurship, artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and data analytics
(none of which I have considerable experience in, but I'm getting there).
